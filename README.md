Ralf is an experimental long-read sequence aligner in Rust.

Ralf depends heavily on the excellent work that is [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio).

I maintain that Ralf is *not* an acronym, but you may remember it as Rust Aligner (Fast, Fun, FASTA)... if that helps.

Ralf is my very first Rust program, so I welcome any and all input.
